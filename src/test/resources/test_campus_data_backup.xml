            <name>Operating Systems</name>
            <description>This course will introduce you to modern operating systems. We will focus on UNIX-based
                operating systems, though we will also learn about alternative operating systems, including Windows. The
                course will begin with an overview of the structure of modern operating systems. Over the course of the
                subsequent units, we will discuss the history of modern computers, analyze in detail each of the major
                components of an operating system (from processes to threads), and explore more advanced topics in the
                field, including memory management and file input/output. The class will conclude with a discussion of
                various system-related security issues.
